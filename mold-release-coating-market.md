<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mold Release Coating Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Internal Mold Releases</li><li>External Mold Releases</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The mold release coating market is categorized into two main types: internal and external mold releases. Internal mold releases are formulated to be integrated within the material, providing a non-stick surface that facilitates easy part removal from the mold, often used in applications like plastic injection and composite manufacturing. External mold releases, on the other hand, are applied directly onto the mold's surface, forming a barrier that prevents adhesion of the material to the mold, commonly utilized in various molding processes.</p></p>
